# TelcoLab
Capstone Project, a virtual lab prototype.

TelcoLab is a website development that is expected to support the adjustment of the implementation of the telecommunications field practicum. This website has a display in the form of a practicum simulator based on code execution so that practitioners can carry out online practicums. Practitioners can access the practicum module, compose code according to the instructions provided, and perform simulations to produce the expected output. There are six modules that can be simulated. The six modules consist of a signal generator module, three amplitude modulation modules (AM DSBFC, AM DSBSC, AM SSB), a frequency modulation module (FM Modulation), and a digital modulation module (Digital Modulation).

This project was created with Django Web Framework 3.2 and consists of a project and three apps.
The explanation of each folder is as follows :
### TelcoLab
It is a project folder that is automatically created when you first create a Django Project. The folder contains all the url settings and configurations of all projects and apps.
### TelcoWeb
This folder is the main app folder which contains the final results from the TelcoLab website.
### TelcoWebOlder
The folder is the second app folder containing the development version of the TelcoLab website. The development is maintained as an app in order to show the differences between the development version and the final version of the TelcoLab website.
### TelcoWebOldest
The folder is the app folder which contains the initial version of the TelcoLab website development.
